            <p>I am Prem Sarawagi from class 4.I love to solve Puzzels and do like to do calculations in different ways.After coming from school and doing my homework whenever I get time I solve Maths questions it keeps my brain busy.I also do abacus and Vedic maths which helps me to do calculations in my mind without using pen and paper.I participate in olyampard and competitive exams so that my skills keep on improving. </p>

            <h4>R D SHARMA is the best book in any context

                Firstly it makes you thorough with the concepts and formulas involved.

                It's solved examples gives you a hint to how to approach a problem.

                It's exercise starts moderately and picks up later with some brainstorming questions where you have to implement all the concepts and formulas.

                At the end of completing a chapter you can be 150% confident about solving any problem related to that chapter.

                Most importantly the standard of the questions and the way he conducts the concepts is awesome

                I truly recommend this book.</h4>
